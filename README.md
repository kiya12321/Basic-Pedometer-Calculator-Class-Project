Pedometer Calculator

A dietician wants you to write a program that will calculate the number of calories a person can lose by walking at a slow pace for a mile; however, the user will have only the distance given by a pedometer, which is measured in steps and not miles.  Assume each mile a person walks is equivalent to 2000 steps, and that for every mile walked, a person loses 65 calories.  Allow the user of the program to enter the number of steps taken throughout the day.  The program will calculate the distance in miles and the number of calories lost.  The user of the program should also be able to enter the day of the week the data is being calculated for.  The day of the week, the distance in miles, and the calories lost should then be displayed to the screen.
