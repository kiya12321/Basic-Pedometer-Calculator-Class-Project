The Algorithm

1)	Determine the number of steps per mile (2000 steps)
2)	Determine the number of calories lost per mile (65 calories) 
3)	Input the amount of steps taken by the user
4)	Calculate the amount of miles walked by the user
5)	Calculate the amount of miles walked by the user

The Pseudocode
//Declare necessary variables 
	Declare String week_day
	Declare Integer user_steps
	Declare Real miles_walked
	Declare Real cal_lost

//Get day of week
	Display “Day of the week”
Input week_day

//Get steps walked
Display “Number of steps walked?”
Input user_steps

//Calculate miles walked
	Set miles_walked =  user_steps / 2000

//Calculate calories lost
Set cal_lost =  miles_walked * 65

//Display output data
Display week_day
Display miles_walked
Display cal_lost
